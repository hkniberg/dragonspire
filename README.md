# Lords of Doomspire

A strategic board game design project with digital simulation for playtesting and AI-powered gameplay.

## What is this?

**Lords of Doomspire** is a 4-player strategic board game where players command knights to explore a dangerous island, gather resources, and ultimately defeat a dragon. This repository contains the complete game design and a TypeScript simulation system that supports both web UI and headless CLI execution for AI-powered playtesting, as well as asset generation and printing.

## Key Documentation

- **[Game Overview](docs/game-overview.md)** - Core game concept and mechanics
- **[Game Rules](docs/game-rules.md)** - Complete rulebook (source of truth)
- **[Player Cheat Sheet](docs/cheat-sheet.md)** - Quick reference for gameplay

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Anthropic API key (for AI features)

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd doomspire/simulation
npm install
```

### Running the Web UI

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Enter your Anthropic API key when prompted (stays local in browser).

### Running CLI Simulation

```bash
# Run a headless game simulation
node run-test.js

# Run a single turn for testing
node run-test.js --single-turn

# Run a specific number of turns
node run-test.js --turns 5

# Run a complete game
node run-test.js --complete
```

The CLI mode supports automated playtesting with AI players for game balance analysis.

## Live Demo

The simulation is deployed at: https://doomspire.vercel.app/

## Asset Generation

The project includes AI-powered tools for generating game assets in the `assetgenerator/` directory. See **[Asset Generator README](assetgenerator/README.md)** for detailed setup and usage instructions.

- **Monster Images**: Generate artwork for creature cards using AI
- **Event Images**: Create illustrations for event cards
- **Treasure Images**: Generate artwork for treasure items
- **Encounter Images**: Create character portraits for encounters
- **Trader Item Images**: Generate equipment and item artwork

### Using the Asset Generator

```bash
cd assetgenerator
npm install

# Generate images for specific card types
node generate-monster-images.js
node generate-event-images.js
node generate-treasure-images.js
node generate-encounter-images.js
node generate-traderItem-images.js
```

The generators use Claude AI to create detailed image prompts based on game content, then generate artwork using DALL-E. All generated assets are saved to the `output/` directory.

See `assetgenerator/README.md` for detailed setup instructions and API key requirements.
