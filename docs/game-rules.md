# LORDS OF DOOMSPIRE - Rulebook

You are a Lord who owns a castle on an island neighboring the resource rich land of **Doomspire** - named so after the fierce mountain range, and the dragon nesting within, guarding the domain.

The ancient dragon rules the island and is considering retiring to another island. It is willing to hand over ownership of Doomspire, but only to a Lord whose knights sufficiently impress it. The others will secure positions in the new hierarchical order... with role of Court Jester awaiting the least impressive Lord.

Beware - the dragon has little patience for those who waste its time. Knights who approach without sufficient preparation will find themselves becoming an unexpected snack.

Compete with other players, explore tiles, fight monsters and other players, claim resources, and buy knights/boats/buildings. Accumulate fame, might, and resources while seeking to impress the dragon at **Doomspire**.

# PART 1 - READ BEFORE STARTING

_This section covers everything you need to play the first round. Player-to-player interactions (combat, trading, territorial disputes) begin in Round 2 and are covered in Part 2._

---

## Starting Resources

Each player starts with:

- 2 Gold
- One home tile in the corner of the board (providing 1 food and 1 wood when harvested)

---

## Victory Conditions

The game ends when the **dragon has been impressed 3 times in total**, and leaves the island in the capable hands of whoever impressed it last.

Players can impress the dragon by reaching **Doomspire** (hidden in the center of the board) and fulfilling any of these conditions:

- **Fame**: Have 15+ Fame. The dragon is impressed by your legendary reputation.
- **Economy**: Own 4+ starred resource tiles. The dragon is impressed by your territorial dominance.
- **Gold**: Have 12+ Gold. The dragon is impressed by your wealth.
- **Combat**: Defeat the dragon in battle. The dragon is impressed by your might.
- **Rings**: During your adventures you may find rings that are very impressive to the dragon.

Failure to impress means becoming the dragon's next meal.

The first two times the dragon gets impressed, the knight that impressed it gets flown home and given 2 resources of their choice. The third player to impress the dragon wins the game and becomes **King of Doomspire**. The remaining players compete for the titles of **Hand of the King** (most resource tiles), **Master of Coin** (most gold), and **Court Jester** (whoever is left).

---

## Board structure

The board is an 8x8 grid of land tiles surrounded by 4 L-shaped ocean tiles in the corners. Knights move around on land tiles, while boats move around on ocean tiles and can transport knights between coastal land tiles.

The board has four biomes: Ocean, Plains, Hills, and Mountains, with increased level of risk & reward as you move towards the mountains in the center.

- **Ocean zones**: The surrounding ocean is divided into 4 ocean zones - northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast.
- **Plains**: These are the outer 2 layers of the 8x8 grid. The outermost tiles are coastal tiles, allowing boat transport.
- **Hills**: This is the second innermost layer of tiles, a ring of tiles surrounding the center.
- **Mountains**: These are the center 4 tiles, containing dragonspire and 3 adventure tiles with high risk/reward.

All hill and mountain tiles start unexplored (face down).

---

## Turn Structure

Each round has 3 phases:

1. **Roll Phase** (Parallel): Move the first player token clockwise, then all players roll dice simultaneously.
2. **Move Phase** (Sequential): One player at a time, use the pre-rolled dice for movement and tile actions
3. **Harvest Phase** (Parallel): Use remaining dice to harvest resources, use buildings, construct new buildings or boats, and recruit new knights.

---

## Phase 1: Roll phase

Move the first player token to the next player clockwise.

Then everyone does this simultaneously:

- **Decide how many dice to roll**: You get 1 die for your castle, and 1 die for each knight.
  - For each die after the first two, you must pay 2 food in **dice tax**. If you can't, you don't get to roll those dice.
- **Roll dice**: Roll all your dice at once. These are your **action dice** for this round. They are used for moving and harvesting.

---

## Phase 2: Movement phase

Movement phase is done one player at a time, starting from the player with the first player token.

Use your pre-rolled action dice one at a time to move and do things with your knights and boats. You may use all your dice for movement, or save some for the harvest phase.

### Move knight (dice action)

Use a dice to move one knight up to that number of steps, and potentially interact with the tile you land on.

- Only horizontal/vertical movement, no diagonal
- Can move fewer steps than the die value, or even move zero steps to interact with your current tile.
- Stop when entering an unexplored tile or tile with monster on it.
- Cannot move a knight into another player's home tile.

**Interacting with other knights**:

- Cannot enter the same tile as another one of your knights.
- (round 1): Cannot enter the same tile as an opposing knight.
- (round 2+): If you stop in the same tile as an opposing knight, you must fight. You may pass through an opposing knight, but the opposing player may force you to stop and fight
- Exception: Special tiles can contain multiple knights, and no combat happens. See Special Tiles.

**Multiple movements**:

- You can use another action die to move the same knight again, as long as the knight has not interacted with a tile. For example if the knight entered a resource tile without claiming it, or entered an adventure tile with no adventure tokens left.

**Tile interaction rules**:

- When a knight enters a tile (whether by normal movement or boat transport), a tile interaction may happen. See Tile Interaction below.
- A dice action can also be used to interact with the current tile without moving - as if the knight entered the same tile again. For example you can stay in the mercenary camp tile and use a dice action each round to gain might.
- Once a knight has interacted with a tile, they cannot use any more action dice this turn.

### Move boat (dice action)

Use a dice to move a boat up to that number of steps, and optionally transport a knight between coastal tiles.

- The boat moves between the four ocean zones - northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast.
- A boat can move fewer steps than the die value.
- An ocean zone can contain any number of boats, boats do not affect or interact with each other.

**Transporting knights via boat**:

- When moving the boat, you may pick up a knight anywhere along the path.
- When finished moving the boat, you must drop the knight at a coastal tile in the target ocean zone. The knight cannot stay on the boat (they get seasick).
- A boat can also use a dice action to stay in the same ocean zone (moving zero steps) and transport a knight between coastal tiles in the same ocean zone.
- A knight can be transported even if it has already interacted with a tile. If so, they cannot interact with the target tile, and they cannot be transported to a tile that requires interaction (for example an adventure tile, or a tile with a monster on it).

> Simple example:
>
> - Alice has a boat in the northwest ocean zone. She has a knight in her home tile at (0,0), and wants to move to a resource tile three steps east (0,3).
> - She only rolled two 1's in the roll phase, and can't reach that tile using knight movement.
> - So she uses one of the dice to do a boat movement of 0 steps, and moves the knight from (0,0) to (0,3) and claims the tile.

> Advanced example:
>
> - Alice has a boat in the northeast ocean zone. She has a knight at her home tile in the northwest corner (0,0), and wants to attack a bear near at (0,6), near the northeast corner.
> - She only rolled a 1 and a 2 in the roll phase, which is not enough to get the knight to the target position using knight movement actions.
> - She uses the 2 to do a boat movement of 2 steps: northeast to northwest, pick up the knight, and then back to northeast to drop it at (0,6), so she can attack the bear.

### Tile interaction

When a knight enters a tile, Tile Interaction may happen, automatically and/or voluntarily.

**Automatic interactions** (in sequence):

- **Explore**: If you enter an unexplored tile you will explore it first and then interact with it. Flip it to reveal the contents.
  - Gain 1 fame for exploring.
  - If it is a bear's den or a resource tile, add a Bear to it (Tier 2 resource tiles are always guarded by a bear).
- **Combat**: If a monster is on the tile, combat will happen. See Combat section below.
- **Impress the dragon**: If you enter Doomspire, you must impress the dragon or be eaten. See Doomspire section below.
- **Adventure**: If you enter an adventure or oasis tile that has remaining adventure tokens, you must draw a card. See Adventure Cards section below.
  - Exception: If combat has already happened, then don't draw an adventure card. Your knight is too exhausted.

**Voluntary interactions**:

After the automatic interactions are done, the player may perform voluntary interactions.

- Use a **special location** - trader/mercenary/temple. See Special Locations section.
- **Claim a resource tile** - place your flag on an unclaimed resource tile. You will now be able to harvest resources from that tile in the harvest phase. See Resource System section.
- Pick up or drop **items** in a tile

> Example:
>
> - Alice's knight enters an unexplored tile.
> - She explores it (automatic interaction), gains 1 fame, flips the tile. It is an adventure card.
> - She flips the adventure card (automatic interaction), and draws a monster.
> - She fights the monster (as part of the same interaction) and wins, gaining further fame and resources.
> - That knight cannot use any more action die this turn, since it has interacted with a tile.

> Example:
>
> - Bob's knight enters an adventure tile which has two adventure tokens.
> - He draws a card (removing one token) and it is a bear. He loses the fight, knight is sent home and the bear stays. So that tile now contains a bear and one remaining adventure token.
> - Next turn, Alice's knight enter the same tile. She is forced to fight the bear (since combat is higher prio than adventure cards). She wins, gains fame and loot from the bear, but cannot draw an adventure card until next turn (which would also require an action die).

---

## Phase 3: Harvest phase

When all players are done with their movement phase, the harvest phase begins. All players can harvest (if they have any remaining action dice), use any castle buildings they already have, and buy a new building/boat/champion if they can afford it.

The harvest phase is done simultaneously rather than one player at a time.

### Harvest (dice action)

Use one or more die to harvest resources from resource tiles.

- Total die value = number of different resource tiles you can harvest from
- You choose which of your claimed resource tiles to harvest from.
- Gain ALL resources from each selected resource tile.
- Using harvest actions is the only way to obtain resources from resource tiles.

> Example:
>
> - This is the first round. Alice rolls 1 and 2 during the roll phase.
> - In the movement phase, Alice uses the 1 to claim a resource tile that provides 2 ore.
> - During the harvest phase, Alice uses the 2 to harvest. She owns 2 resource tiles - her home tile (providing 1 food and 1 wood), and the new tile she claimed (providing 2 ore). So she can harvest from both tiles and gains 1 food, 1 wood, and 2 ore.

### Use buildings

Use your blacksmith or fletcher to build your might, or use your market to sell resources for gold. See Buildings section.

### Build

At the end of the harvest phase you can perform one build action (construct a building, recruit a knight, buy a boat, etc). No dice is used for this. See Buildings section.

Build happens last, after using buildings. So you can't use a building the same turn you built it.

---

## Adventure cards

An adventure card is drawn when a knight enters an unoccupied adventure tile or oasis tile that has remaining adventure tokens.

### Adventure card tiers

Each adventure tile has 1 to 3 question marks, indicating the tier of the adventure card to draw. Higher tier means higher risk/reward. As you move towards the mountains in the center of the board, the tier of the adventure cards increases.

### Adventure card themes

Each adventure card has a theme (indicated by the art on the backside), which gives you a hint about which kinds of monsters and resources may show up:

- **Beast adventure cards**: More likely to provide food resources, and monsters are more likely to be beasts (relevant to some items)
- **Cave adventure cards**: More likely to provide ore resources and cave-dwelling monsters.
- **Grove adventure cards**: More likely to provide wood resources and forest creatures.

### Adventure card types

When you draw an adventure card, you may get a:

- **Monster card**: Fight the monster or flee, earn fame and resources if you win. See Combat section.
- **Event card**: Could lead to earning items, gaining fame, moving yourself or other players, and all kinds of things depending on the event.
- **Treasure card**: Often contain items that your knight can carry. See Items section.
- **Encounter card**: Often contain followers that will join your knight. See Followers section.

---

## Monster combat

Monstar combat happens when:

- A knight enters a tile with a monster
- A knight draws a monster adventure card

### Fleeing monster combat

A knight may attempt to flee from combat, for example if the odds of winning are too low.

Roll 1D3:

- **1: Failure**. Combat happens as normal.
- **2: Partial success**. Knight flees to closest unoccupied tile owned by that player, and loses 1 resource of their choice. If no owned tiles are available, flee home (but still lose 1 resource).
- **3: Success**. Knight flees to home tile, without any loss.

### Resolving monster combat

- Roll 1D3
- Add your Might
- Add +2 for each supporting knight or warship adjacent to the combat tile. Even from other players, if they choose to support you. No diagonals.
- Decide whether to use bonuses from items or followers.
- The resulting attack value must be greater than or equal to the monster's Might to win.

If you win, gain the fame and loot printed on the card.

If you lose, your knight must go home and heal.

- Move the knight back to your home tile
- Lose 1 resource of your choice.

### Losing resources

If you have no resource to lose, then lose 1 fame instead. If you don't have any fame either, then you don't lose anything.

### Combat support from other players

- In combat, support can be received from neighbouring knights/warships, even from other players who choose to support you.
- Support from other players is announced after the combat dice roll. This opens up for collaboration, diplomacy, and treachery ("Hey, you said you would support me!". "Sorry, I lied.")
- Monsters cannot receive support.

> Example: Calculating the odds of winning
>
> Bob has 1 might and wants to figure out if that bandit with 3 might is worth fighting.
>
> - 1D3 roll gives 1, 2, or 3.
> - +1 might gives 2, 3 or 4.
> - Bob needs 3 or more to win, so 67% chance (rolls of 2 or 3). Worth trying!

> Example: Support in action
>
> Alice has 1 might, 2 knights, and the warship upgrade. She wants to attack a bear with 5 might. The bear is in a coastal tile.
>
> - She moves knight 1 to a neighbouring tile, and uses her boat to transport knight 2 into the tile with the bear. Combat ensues, with support from both knight 1 and the warship.
> - Alice rolls 1D3 and gets a 2.
> - +1 might = 3.
> - +4 supporting units (2 units × +2 each) = 7.
> - 7 is >= 5 (the bear's might), so Alice wins.

## Doomspire - impressing the dragon

Doomspire is in one of the four unexplored mountain tiles in the middle.

When doomspire is revealed, the dragon's treasure hoard is also revealed.

- Take 3 of each type of resource (12 in total).
- Randomly organize them into 3 stacks (4 resources per stack)
- Place the 3 stacks on the dragon tile

When you enter the doomspire tile, you must impress the dragon or get eaten.

- If you have 15+ fame, 12+ gold, or own 4+ starred resource tiles, you automatically impress the dragon.
- If not, you must fight the dragon - fleeing is impossible. You can't kill the dragon, but defeating it in combat will impress it.

### Result of impressing the dragon

- Take one of the treasure stacks as reward.
- If that was the last treasure stack, the dragon has been impressed for the third time and you win the game immediately. See Final Ranking section.
- Otherwise the dragon flies you to your home tile.

### Result of failing to impress the dragon

- Your knight gets eaten and taken off the board, along with any followers and items they are carrying.

If you lose your last knight, you can choose whether to stay in the game and save up for a new knight (you still get one die every turn), or concede defeat. See Conceding defeat.

---

## Final Ranking

When the dragon leaves the island (after being impressed three times), establish the final ranking:

**Final ranking**:

- **King of Doomspire**: The last player to impress the dragon.
- **Hand of the King**: Player with the most resource tiles claimed. Tiebreaker: most starred resource tiles. If still tied, King decides.
- **Master of Coin**: Player with the most gold. Tiebreaker: total resources (gold + food + wood + ore). If still tied, King decides.
- **Court Jester**: The remaining player. That player must clean up the mess (but may beg for help).

Tip: Don't be the jester.

---

## Conceding defeat

A player can choose to concede defeat, for example if their situation is hopeless.

- Remove all boats and knights from the board (including items and followers)
- Claimed tiles (including the home tile) are considered owned by a neutral player, and can be blockaded or conquered using the normal rules.

---

## Items

A knight can carry up to 2 items by default, typically weapons or tools that give extra might or other advantages.

Items can be obtained by:

- Buying from the trader
- Attacking another knight and stealing their item (from round 2)
- Adventure cards
- Picking up items left by other players

Dropping items:

- An item can be dropped at any time, for example to make space for a new item.
- The dropped item is left in the tile (leave a marker), and can be picked up by another knight who ends their turn in that tile.

Some items and followers allow the knight to carry more items.

Picking up or dropping items does not count as a tile interaction, and does not require an action die.

---

## Followers

A knight can have up to 2 followers, who give the knight various advantages.

- Followers can only be obtained throught adventure cards
- Followers cannot be bought, dropped in a tile, or stolen by another player.
- Followers can be dismissed at any time, in which case they are removed from the game.

---

## Resource System

The game has 4 types of resources: **gold**, **food**, **wood**, and **ore**. Resources are used to:

- Buy buildings, knights, and boats
- Use your blacksmith/fletcher to increase your might
- Use your market to sell resources for gold
- Exchange items at the trader
- Pay for healing after losing combat
- Pay food tax for rolling extra dice
- Trade with other players

**How to earn resources**:

- Claim resource tiles and use action dice to harvest from them
- Defeat monsters
- Some adventure cards give resources
- (round 2+) Stealing from other players or blockading their resource tiles

Owning resource tiles let you build a sustainable economy. They can also be used to impress the dragon economically (own 4 starred resource tiles and visit the dragon).

**Types of resource tiles**:

- **Home tile**: Provides 1 wood and 1 food. Opposing knights cannot enter this tile.
- **Normal resource tiles**: Provide 1 resource.
- **Starred resource tiles**: Resource tiles that provide more than one resource are considered starred resource tiles. All resource tiles in Tier 2 region are starred, and some in Tier 1. The dragon will be impressed if you own 4+ starred resource tiles.

**Claiming a resource tile**:

- To claim a resource tile, move a knight to an unclaimed resource tile and place a flag on it. This is now considered your tile.
- In Round 1, all resource interactions are peaceful - no disputes over territory yet!

---

## Buildings and Build Actions

- **Recruit Knight**
  - Costs 3 Food, 3 Gold, and 1 Ore
  - Gives you another knight, place it on your home tile.
  - Also gives you 1 extra die at the start of every turn, if you can afford the food tax (2 food).
  - You can have max 3 knights in total
- **Build Boat**:
  - Costs 2 Wood, 2 Gold
  - Gives you an additional boat. Place it outside your home tile
  - You can have max 2 boats in total
- **Warship upgrade**:
  - Costs 2 Wood, 1 Ore, 1 Gold
  - All boats become warships, allowing them to support coastal battles.
  - Future boats automatically become warships.
- **Market**:
  - Costs 2 Food, 2 Wood
  - Allows you to sell any number of resources 2:1 for gold during the harvest phase.
  - Example: Sell 3 food and 1 wood for 2 gold.
- **Blacksmith**:
  - Costs 2 Food, 2 Ore
  - Allows you to buy 1 Might for 1 Gold + 3 Ore once per harvest phase

- **Monastery** (chapel upgrade):
  - Costs 8 Wood, 3 Gold, 1 Ore
  - You must build a chapel first.
  - Upon construction, you gain 5 fame

---

## Special Tiles

These special locations provide additional interactions.

- **Temple**:
  - Sacrifice 2 Fame to gain 1 Might (once per turn)
- **Trader**:
  - Trade resources at a 2:1 rate. You can convert any resource into any other resource. For example trade 3 food + 1 wood for 2 ore.
  - Buy items for gold. The trader deck is open for anyone to look at during the game, and contains useful items to aid your journey. Note that items can run out of stock.
- **Mercenary Camp**:
  - Pay 3 Gold to gain 1 Might (once per turn)

A knight can stay in a special tile in order to use it repeatedly, but they can only use it once per round, and they still need to use an action die to stand still and interact with the tile.

Special tiles are non-combat zones, so multiple knights can be there and battle cannot happen.

---

## End of Part 1

Congratulations! You now know everything needed to play the first round of Lords of Doomspire.

After completing Round 1, players will have claimed files, fought monsters, and/or harvested resources.

At the beginning of Round 2, we need to introduce some additional mechanics:

- Fighting other knights
- Fighting the dragon
- Territorial disputes
- Trading between players

---

# PART 2

Read this during the dice roll phase of round 2.

---

## Fighting other knights

Knight to knight combat happens when:

- You enter a tile with an opposing knight on it
- You attempt to pass through an opposing knight's tile, and they choose to block you

### Fleeing knight to knight combat

If you get attacked by another knight you can attempt to flee from combat. This works like fleeing from monster combat.

Roll 1D3:

- **1: Failure**. Combat happens as normal.
- **2: Partial success**. Knight flees to closest unoccupied tile owned by that player, and gives 1 resource or item to the attacking player. If no owned tiles are available, flee home (but still give 1 resource). The fleeing player chooses which resource or item to give.
- **3: Success**. Knight flees to home tile, without any loss.

### Resolving knight to knight combat

- Both players roll 2D3
- Each knight applies their own combat bonuses: Might + supporting units + item/follower effects. Same as with monster combat.
- Highest value wins. Ties are rerolled until someone wins.
- The winner gains 1 fame and gets to steal one resource or item.
- The losing knight goes home.

### Stealing resource or items

- Items are personal - they are stolen from the defeated knight and given to the winning knight. You can't take items from or give items to a knight that wasn't in the battle.
- Followers cannot be stolen.

---

## Fighting the dragon

Dragon combat happens if you enter doomspire and are unable to impress the dragon through fame/ownership/gold.

Dragon combat works like knight to knight combat, except that you can't flee.

The dragon has might 8.

- Pick another player to represent the dragon - ideally your biggest rival!
- Both you and the dragon roll 2D3
- Apply combat bonuses: Might + supporting units + item/follower effects.
- Highest value wins. Ties are rerolled until someone wins.

Losing means getting eaten by the dragon.

---

## Territorial disputes

Players can dispute control over resource tiles.

**Protecting a resource tile**:

- A claimed resource tile is protected if the owner has a knight in an adjacent tile.
- A protected tile cannot be interfered with. If an opposing knight is in another player's protected resource tile, it cannot blockade, conquer, or incite revolts.

**Blockading a resource tile** (free):

- If a knight is on an unprotected resource tile owned by another player, that resource tile is blockaded.
- A blockaded tile is treated just as if it was owned by the blockading player, as long as the blocking knight is there. When blockaded, the owner cannot harvest from it, and the blockader can.

**Inciting revolt on a resource tile** (costs fame):

- You can use treachery to incite revolt on another player's unprotected resource tile
- Reduce your fame by 1 and remove the other player's claim (but don't take over the tile)
- Can also be done after combat
- This frees up the tile, so you can take it next turn by staying in the tile and using an action die.

**Conquering a resource tile** (costs might):

- You can use violence to take over another player's unprotected resource tile
- Reduce your might by 1 and switch the other player's claim for your own
- Can also be done after combat

> Blockade example:
>
> - Alice owns 4 resource tiles: her home tile (1 food, 1 wood), a gold tile (2 gold), a wood tile (1 wood), and an ore tile (2 ore).
> - Bob has 2 knights, one on Alice's gold tile and one on her wood tile, attempting to blockade them.
> - Alice has a knight adjacent to her gold tile, so it is automatically protected from blockade. But her wood tile is unprotected.
> - During the harvest phase, Alice uses a 2 to harvest. Her eligible resource tiles are her home tile, the gold tile, and the ore tile - but not the wood tile because it's blockaded. She chooses to harvest from the gold and ore tiles, gaining 2 gold and 2 ore.
> - Bob also harvests, using a 1. He doesn't own any resource tiles other than his home tile. His eligible resource tiles are his home tile and Alice's wood tile that he is blockading. He needs wood, so he chooses to harvest from the wood tile, gaining 1 wood.

## Trading Between Players

- Players can freely trade resources (food, wood, ore, gold) with other players anytime
- Items cannot be directly traded (only indirectly via drop/pickup)
- Followers cannot be traded
